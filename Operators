#python Operatoes
#Arithmetic Operators

print(10+20)#Addition
print(20-10)#Substraction
print(10*20)#multiplication
print(20/10)#division
print(20%10)#Modulous
print(15//4)#floor division 7.5 but it the results to the nearsest whole number
#Assingment Operator
a=20


a+=5#+= it is same as a=a*5
print(a)
a*=5# it is same as a=a*5

#print(a)
a/=5# it is same as a=/5
print(a)




#exponential

a=2**5 #exponential
print(a)
a//=3#a=a//3
a**2#a=a**2 i.e.20*20
print(a)

#comparison Operator
print(3==3)#Equal
print(3!=4)#not equal
print(3>4)#greater  than
print(3<4)#lesser  than 
print(3>=4)#greater than equal
print(3<=4)#less than equal





#logical operators
x=2

print(x<5 and x<8)#Return True if both the statement are true
print(x<5 and x>8)
#print(x<5 || x>8)#Return true if anyone of the condition is met 
#print(x<5 or x>8)#Return true if anyone of the condition is met
print(x>3 or x>10)
print(not(x>3 or x>10))#reverse the result for example--if the result is true it will return false or vise versa






#identity Operators
a=[10, 20]
b=[10,20]
c=a
a.remove(20)
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)
print(a is c)#Returns true if both the variable are the same object pointing to the same memory location
print(b is c)#it will return false because b is not pointing to the same memory location
